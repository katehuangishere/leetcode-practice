Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+

Result table:
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |
| 1       | 3       | 1          | 20             |
| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).
```

SELECT 
  LEAST(from_id, to_id) AS person1, 
  GREATEST(from_id, to_id) AS person2, 
  COUNT(*) AS call_count, 
  SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY person1, person2
ORDER BY person1, person2;
